# Hotel-Booking-Analysis-EDA-

The dataset used in this project compares booking information between a city hotel and a resort hotel. It includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay,number of adults,children or babies and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.
The project went through the basic idea of EDA and visualization.

The main objective is to explore and analyze the hotel booking data to discover important factors that govern the hotel booking and give insights to Hotel Management, which can perform various campaigns to boost the business and performance.
